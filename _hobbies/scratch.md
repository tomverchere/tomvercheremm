Here is a maze game called Dragon Hunter that I made for the Scratch project. It has two levels, in the first one you collect a sword to be able to beat the Dragon in the second level.

In this project, I've learned how to:
- Use Scratch, including how to add my own images, and sounds.
- Understand in a way the structure of code and to solve problems as they appear.
  - Eg. If this action happens, this component will respond in this way.

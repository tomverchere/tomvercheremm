This is the image I created using GIMP, and the original picture respectively

<img src="/images/finalassignment.png" alt="Image created with GIMP" width="360" height="480"><img src="/images/Fishing.jpg" alt="Group of people in front of a lake" width="360" height="480">

In the edited picture, I added a hiker in the bottom left, and a dog to the right of the group. I also changed the sky.

In this project, I've learned how to:
- Utilize the GIMP software
- Adding images on top of another, creating layers
- Modify the color and the resolution of the image

This is a graphic created using GIMP.

Here is the original picture:
<img src="/images/fishing.jpg" alt="Group of people in front of a lake">

In this project, I've learned how to:
- Utilize the GIMP software
- Adding images on top of another, creating layers
- Modify the color and the resolution of the image

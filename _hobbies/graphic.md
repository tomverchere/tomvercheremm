The first image is the one that I created using GIMP, and the second is the original picture.

![no-alignment]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/gimpimage.png)

In the edited picture, I added a hiker in the bottom left, and a dog to the right of the group. I did so by adding them as layers on top of the original image and adjusting the resolution and color. I also changed the sky in the background by erasing the original sky and having a picture of a different sky in the layer underneath.

In this project, I've learned how to:
- Utilize the GIMP software
- Add images on top of another, creating layers
- Modify the color and the resolution of the image

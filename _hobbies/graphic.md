This is the image I created using GIMP, and the original picture respectively.

![Group of people in front of a lake](/images/gimpimage.png)

In the edited picture, I added a hiker in the bottom left, and a dog to the right of the group. I also changed the sky.

In this project, I've learned how to:
- Utilize the GIMP software
- Add images on top of another, creating layers
- Modify the color and the resolution of the image

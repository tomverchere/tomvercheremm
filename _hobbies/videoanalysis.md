Here is a video analysis of me doing a box jump. The video was edited using the Dartfish software.

<video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="path/to/your/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

In this project I've learned how to:
- Use the Dartfish software, both on Computer and Mobile
- Analyze a video, including:
  - Finding the key frames to make into stills
  - How to edit the video by adding angles, text, and lines

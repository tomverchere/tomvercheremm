Here is a video analysis of a professional volleyball player, Micah Stahl, doing a jump serve. The video was edited using the Dartfish software.

In this project I've learned how to:
- Use the Dartfish software, both on Computer and Mobile
- Analyze a video of a movement, including:
  - Finding the key frames to make into stills
  - How to edit the video by adding angles, text, and lines
- Analyze a full sports game
  - Utilizing the software to keep track of points, or certain actions, such as blocks and spikes in volleyball
